# Final_Project

Data Collection

The data for this project was collected from the Cuyahoga County website - https://myplace.cuyahogacounty.us/

We build a web scraper to compile a list of housing data into a CSV file which ended up with about 12000 lines from three zipcodes in Cuyahoga County.

Data Cleaning

We used a combination of Excel and PostgreSQL to clean the data a prepare it for our ML model.

ML Model

We loaded our data into a linear regression machine learning model and then used the model to predict property value.

Final Product

We used a Flask app to locally launch our website where users could input the attributes for the machine learning model. Utilizing Javascript we were able to have our model predict property value and display it for the user.
